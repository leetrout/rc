        Current thoughts:

        <li>
          My mental health through RC is top priority
          <ul>
            <li>
              No negative self talk for not accomplishing programming tasks as long as I have been productive in some way
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This is not an excuse to be undisciplined

              Embrace JOMO. The Joy Of Missing Out. There is a lot going on and no way I can participate in all of the things that interest me. Good!

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Everyone here is _fantastic_. I am sure it helps that we largely self selected to participate.

          For a second day this is going exactly as I imagined it would

          Talk less, show more

        <li>
          Stick to the plan from D1 and finish building out my online space to organize and share information
        </li>
        <li>
          Daily checkins are the minimum amount of comms for me so might make more use of

        Overall it has been a fantastic week but I am nowhere near where I need to be.
        <br>
        Certainly not where I want to be, either, but getting my personal site fixedup
        <br>
        is holding up being able to free my mind. This weekend it has to be finished
        <br>
        so I can get my podcast edited and the first episode with show notes published.

        That relates to the
        <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/">
          story from "Art &amp; Fear"
        </a>
        where a class was split into being graded on quantity vs quality and the quality was higher in the group focused on quantity. I am sure I am on the correct path to recovery from my burn out and now I am almost scared to commit to just doing the work. Like my brain has some finite amount of cycles and I am going to exhaust them. It is a very unusual and somewhat unsettling idea (surely without merit).

        I have a long internal thread around ... if software is so value (can generate high valuations, high paying jobs), how can I directly engage that? I'm personally debating between doing a (probably ML themed) job search and continuing to learn and grow and starting a company / building a product (trying to benefit directly) -- but it's very related to: how can I work in a culture that works for me, not against me? By building that culture?

        my favorite book in this arena is Reinventing Organizations. It's probably one of my top 5 most important things I've read that I keep very firmly in the altar of my heart.

        I think there are a lot of interesting tactical questions like - a consulting / services group vs. finding a compelling product area / vision and diving in.
      </p>
      <p>
        right now there's exactly one AI company i'm on the fence about applying to, and a lot of really just comes down to "do i really think my own values will be fully expressed there?" (or can I tactically justify the role as an intermediate step -- which I am dubious of, but considering.)

        Had lunch with a friend that works in video games and picked his brain about some things and spent the night at All Things Open Spacewalk meetup in downtown Raleigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        In between, however, we did the knowledge management lean coffee! I LOVED it! So glad I got to introduce lean coffee to so many new folks and we had a great discussion around knowledge management tools and workflows. I suspect we might do it again...

        Had to go to a meeting out of town which sucked up my morning and then I decided to go have tea with my mom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thought I would be back online in the afternoon but decided to go to my kid's gymnastics class and out to dinner with the fam.

      <p>
        Spending the past two days largely away from the computer doing social things was the right call. Somewhat unexpectedly I _really_ missed the rhythm RC has got me in.

        I think this is the first time in a year I have had a _great_ week. Not just OK; thoroughly enjoying every day. Talking with so many fascinating folks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tonight / tomorrow morning I have to finish my slides for my presentation on my favorite tools which was spurred by the Hugo work I was doing when RC started.

        Content creation has went well but I am missing all kinds of written content so I need to do some digital gardening and dig up old content from old versions of my site and get things published. It's nice to have a workflow emerging and knowing I have a space to dump things.
      </p>
      <p>
        So to recap:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Podcast is publishing via Microfeed on the CloudFlare stack (pages, D1, R2, DNS)
        </li>
        <li>
          Website is published via CloudFlare pages + GitHub
          <ul>
            <li>

        I would say I will lose 90 minutes to the show notes and final prep / push for episode 1 which gives me a ton of time to dig in on something else... which I think will be starting the weekend raytracing walkthrough in earnest and spending more cycles on geometry.

        This week is going to be super busy for me. Real life has crept back in and I am going to have to travel on Thursday and Friday but hopefully I will manage to salvage half the day on Friday but likely won't have a written checkin Thursday.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's gonna be a great week!

        Today (day 13) I will miss impossible stuff day due to external obligations and I am bummed. I still have an idea about analyzing roads that I have no idea how to accomplish so I might try to make it to maptime (which I was just too tired to attend last night).

      <p>
        I have not used C++ since ~2000 and I want to write the raytracer in Go so I have most likely screwed something up translating the authors code. I chased my tail for a couple hours getting the background to work correctly due to misinterpreting the c++ semantics and mutating my vec3 struct in Go when it should have been left alone so it might be the same thing causing the sphere to be visualized wrong. I will be back in the swing of things Friday afternoon and will add unit tests around my vec3 implementation to ensure it's core behavior is correct.

        I ended up missing impossible day on Thursday 1/19 (day 13) and everything on Friday 1/20 (day 14). I really missed getting to read all the updates and see what everyone has been doing... time is slipping through my hands and it's not a good feeling. This offically marks half-way through my batch and I don't have much to show.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tinkered all weekend on the raytracing work and after chasing my tail for hours today I can finally render something somewhat interesting (as have all those that came before me).

        My focus this week is going to be on finishing the first part of the raytracing book and then exploring some proceedural coding with wave function collapse (of which I only know what it does but not how to use it or "make it"). So many ideas and interesting things and so little time

        for pairing and giving me the explanation on all the vector basics and helping my intuition around what is happening inside my raytracer.

        I think tomorrow I am just going to keep watching more on vector things and keep working sample problems and push off the WFC stuff another day or two.

        out of them, but it can be hard to describe what I'm feeling sometimes. I hope you have a great weekend, too

        This is the start of the final two weeks of my six week batch and I want to both focus and continue to play and explore the things that interest me outside of my normal "job." These final, few days will be spent exploring more graphics, proceedurally generating things (will at least complete one WFC tutorial) and have something playable along the likes of the 7DRL challenge[0] (I would be doing the "out of challenge" variant). Unsure if I will do some more graphics specific work on the raytracer or move on to other small experiments in Go.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          7DRL Challenges are NOT about being a fast coder, but rather proving you can release a finished, playable roguelike to the world. There is no winner of the challenge, but rather all those who finish are honoured for their work, the criterion is completeness.

        I was inspired to think about what I want to accomplish with my 7DRL challenge and the chat yesterday reinforced my belief I should probably just use Godot.

        If I don't use Godot these are the Go-based engines I am considering (in order of popularity):

        I have been doodling game mechanics on the whiteboard and I am thinking with the firefighter theme it might be neat to try to make it realistic and you have a fixed length of hose which will limit your move amount and require you to exit and re-enter the building to extend when you realize you are out of movement with the current length.
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems like a good way for me to engage with various pathfinding algorithms in a unique way that's not just enemy movement.

        I am attracted to falling sand games like
        <a href="https://sandspiel.club/">
          sandspiel
        </a>
        and Noita (and I have played a bit of noita since it has a combustion mechanic) but I don't think I want to do a side scroller so I've been wondering what this would be like if it were top down or isometric with multiple layers. I am clearly distracted with the graphics and need to just start writing code and moving on

        Movement is typically very important in roguelikes. They are all about carefully using your turns to confront enemies at the right time. I love your hose idea because it would be a very neat innovation on that theme!

        I didn't feel well this morning so got a late start. Short update here - spent the entire day on video with various folks and managed to squeeze in a quick stream tonight trying to figure out how to co-stream with desktop views on twitch.
      </p>

        I am pretty pumped to see everyone learning so much stuff. I had fun playing with p5.js and I see why so many folks use it. It was fun to just open a browser and make something!

        The quality and latency is better when you have direct connections vs streaming a view of discord or zoom and rebroadcasting that but it doesn't make a huge difference if you don't need to switch between various layouts and still want control of camera placement

        Nothing to report from Monday 2/6. I played with Godot but have not figured out all the movement mechanics. Partially from stalling because I am spending more time with the engine's UX instead of just bush whacking through to make something functional. I did make it to the graphics book club meeting and I acquired the book. Looking forward to participating as an alum!

        Realistically I won't get a ton of stuff accomplished today due to coffee chats and pairing. This is what I am RC for and would much rather do that than just sit here working alone which I can do any time.

        I am declaring bankruptcy on the Roguelike game. I have thoroughtly enjoyed researching games and learning Godot. Importantly I am not going to give up on the idea but there is just way too much to learn and do to accomplish what I want to do and there is no way it's gonna happen tomorrow which ends my seven days for the roguelike challenge (7DRL).

        So two days left and I am not going to make any commitments on project deliverables. I'll keep plugging away on some Godot things and try to finish the WFC tutorial.

        Lots of chats the past couple days in lieu of coding on my own projects. I feel I must reiterate: this is where I have found tremendous value in RC. Thank you everyone for all the talking and listening! You'll always be able to find me in

        Of course I knew on the first day there would be a last day but it arrived much quicker than I expected. RC was everything I expected and more. There is something special here and I am very happy to have been able to participate remotely. It was great to meet so many wonderful people and learn about all the varied interests and topics!
      </p>
      <p>
        I applied to RC not knowing what to expect. I had an absolute blast working on the programming challenge (I did the space invaders clone) but I could still feel the twinges of burnout in October. It's still there but nothing like it was so many months ago. The people, the ideas, and the conversations here all contributed to reminding me why I got into tech and how much fun can be had at all levels of the stack and at all stages in our journey to master the technical interests we have.
      </p>
      <p>
        I leave energized, refreshed and excited to make another go at my career in the same stage I left instead of abandoning it. I'm not sure what will come of it but this experience has solidified my desire to lead, teach, coach and mentor more than just sling code. I hope folks like me continue to get the opportunity to participate in this program and they are as welcome as I have been to be more on the fringe of programming than breathing and living it every minute of every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I cannot say thank you enough! I am excited to stay involved as an alum and look forward to the next chapter!
      </p>

        Until later... it's now!
